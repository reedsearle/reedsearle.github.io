## INTRODUCTION

I am a graduate of the Deep Dive Coding IoT Bootcamp who is moving on to JAVA development on Android phones.  I also have degrees in Aerospace Engineering, Electrical Engineering and an MBA.

Two truths and one lie:
1) I raced motorcycles at NH International Speedway
2) I flew helicopters from the decks of Korean fishing ships for a year
3) There is a picture of me in front of the space shuttle Discovery after it landed at Edwards Airforce Base
